Hello and thank you for coming to take a look at my repo for my milestone 1 project. 

This Repo was designed to showcase my web developer skillset at the beginning of my 1-year course studying with Code Institute!

![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)

This was primarily using only HTML and CSS to create a static webpage which had to have clean code (through online validators for the current standards of HTML5 and CSS3 respectively.

As I learn more in this course, I will fork this repository and update this over time to serve as a personal CV in website form in order to secure work within the tech industry.

# User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI)

  <summary>User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI)</summary>
  
### User Stories
  
##### First-Time Visitor Goals

  As a first-time visitor, I want:  

- Clearly understand that this is a portfolio website  
- to have a quick understanding of the mission statement of the website
- to have quick easy forms of contact for the owner of the website  
  
##### Return/frequent Visitor Goals

  As a return/frequent visitor, I want:  

- to be able to navigate quickly to contact details or the submission form if relevant to contact the owner of the site. 
  
##### Website's Owner Goals

  As the developer I want:

- to provide a clear use website for the user to understand my capabilities. 
- to provide clear concise information

##### Website's Owner Goals

I opted for a single scroll page using anchor points that were quick to navigate using the navbar that was located at the top of the screen window.

I used a combination of a small amount of custom CSS, alongside the CSS populated by the Bootstrap 5 CDN files and some Minor Javascript to populate icons from the Font-Awesome website that hosts a variety of icons including the icons used for my social media links in my footer bar located at the bottom of viewport.

Through the process, I learned the importance of using a wireframe at the very beginning of the project in order to drive a clear goal from the initial inception through to the final deployment. In my excitement to get stuck into the project, I neglected this area until the final 2 versions of which I had gone through a previous idea that essentially had to be entirely reworked. 

This was due to me trying to incorporate javascript into the webpage for animations, and functions back when I had opted for a multipage design. Once I had realized I was steering the project in the wrong direction, I course-corrected and scaled it back to the core to really focus on the root goal.

My goal was to make sure, that on first glance, the UX is clear to the user and they recognize that this is a portfolio with all key elements quickly accessible via the Sticky nav bar at the top of the page. 

To make my page stand out, I've opted for a single scroll Nav/Anchor page design. This saves time on page loading and benefits the overall user experience. I also made it a point to aim to ensure that the user does not have to click a button on the page more than 3 times in order to reach their desired destination.

I hope to improve and practice over time and will be honing my skills in designing websites for two creative artists; a Musician and a Dancer and hope to Hone my craft over this holiday period with the introduction of javascript into my repertoire.  

Please use the "python3 -m http.server" script in the terminal window to run the project in the browser to test port window "8000"
