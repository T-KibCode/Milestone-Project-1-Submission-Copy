Use the "python3 -m http.server" scrpit in terminal window to run the project in broswer to test.

Started New milestone1 project from scratch. Will reference various steps in readme file.

So far, made to sets of html, css and js files as I need the mutlipage layout to operate slightly different depending on the landing page being navigated from. 

I have created the intial landing page with my company logo (free use creation). It hosts a button Icon upon the Enter text that navigates to the main Menu/Landing page with the website.

At this moment I am considering using JS to creation a navigation animation depending on media Query device's. With regards to the mobile version, there will be a small version of the background image with the Enter button Front and centre the logo smaller above it. 

After linking my entry page to the main navigation page, I will be using bootstrap to build some of the assets within the page such as the nav bar amongst other elements for ease of use at the moment. Once I have a stronger Grasp over bootstrap, I may insert customer CSS, but it remains to be seen.
