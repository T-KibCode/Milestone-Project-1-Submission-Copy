milestone-project-1-readme file.

Hello and thank you for coming to take a look at my repo for my milestone 1 project. 

This Repo was designed to showcase my web developer skillset at the beggining of my 1 year course studying with the ![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)!

This was primarily using only HTML and CSS to create a static webpage which had to have clean code (through online validators for the current standards of HTML5 and CSS3 respectively.

As I learn more in this course, I will fork this repository and update this over time to serve as a personal CV in website form in order to secure work within the tech industry.

I opted for a single scroll page using anchor points that were quick to navigate to using to the navbar that was located at the top of the screen window.

I used a combination of a small amount of custom CSS, alongside the CSS populated by the Bootstrap 5 CDN files and some Minor Javascript to populate icons from the Font-Awesome webstite that hosts a variety of icons including the icons used for my social media links in my footer bar located at the bottom of viewport.

Through the process, I learnt the importance of using a wireframe at the very beggining of the project in order to drive a clear goal from the inital inception through to the final deployment. In my excitement to get stuck in to the project, I neglected this area until the final 2 versions of which I had gone through a previous idea that essentially had to be entirely reworked. 

This was due to me trying to incorparate javascript into the webpage for animations, functions back when I had opted for a multipage design. Once I had realised I was steering the project in the wrong direction, I course corrected and scaled it back to the core to really focus on the root goal.

My goal was to make sure, that on first glance, the UX is clear to the user and they recognise that this is a portfolio with all key elements quickly accessible via the Sticky nav bar at the top of the page. 

To make my page stand out, I've opted for a single scroll Nav/Anchor page design. This saves time on the page loading and benefits the overall user experience. I also made it a point to aim to ensure that the user does not have to click a button on the page more then 3 times in order to reach their desired destination. 

I hope to improve and practice over time and will be honing my skils designing websites for two creative artists; a Musician and a Dancer and hope to Hone my craft over this holiday period with the introduction of javascript into my repertoire.  

Please use the "python3 -m http.server" scrpit in terminal window to run the project in broswer to test port window "8000"
